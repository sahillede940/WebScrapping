 Any third Party Insurance for UPS / Fedex / DHL from Canada? 
I want to buy insurance for items I ship with UPS / Fedex / DHL (NOT Canada Post).

If I use Netparcel, the insurance costs 2.5% to 3% of the item value (ex: $1000 item -> $30) which is quite expensive.

Are there cheaper 3rd party options for insurance that I can use? Shippo seems to offer insurance at 1.5% of item value, but they only offer Canada Post shipping, not Fedex/UPS/DHL.

Thanks!
